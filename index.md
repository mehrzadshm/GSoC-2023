# Question-Answering over DBpedia with Pretrained Auto-regressive Models

## Project Summary
This [project] aims to tackle the challenge of generating formal SPARQL queries from natural language questions to streamline and simplify the extraction of information from [DBpedia] knowledge graph. This is an instrumental process in fostering intuitive, factual dialogues that are backed with open knowledge graphs such as DBpedia.

Among the exsiting approaches to this problem, i.e., classification, ranking, and translation, this proposal will primarily focus on the latter one. The key motivation behind this decision is the significant performance improvement observed with the use of pre-trained large language models in translation tasks. However, our objective goes beyond merely refining the task of text-to-sparql translation; Our ambition is to deliver an intuitive interface to clear the path for the extensive adoption of open knowledge graphs across various sectors.
