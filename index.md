# Question-Answering over DBpedia with Pretrained Auto-regressive Models

## Project Summary
This project aims to contribute to addressing the challenge of generating formal SPARQL queries from natural language questions, thereby facilitating intuitive question-answering from open knowledge graphs, such as DBpedia. This is an instrumental process in fostering intuitive dialogues that are based on the facts incorporated within knowledge graphs.

Among the exsiting approaches to this problem, i.e., classification, ranking, and translation, this proposal will primarily focus on the latter one. The key motivation behind choosing the translation approach is the significant performance improvement observed with the use of pre-trained large language models in translation tasks. However, our objective goes beyond merely refining the task of text-to-sparql translation; Our ambition is to deliver an intuitive interface for open knowldge graphs such as DBpedia to clear the path for the extensive adoption of open knowledge graphs across various sectors.
